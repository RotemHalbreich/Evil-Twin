## :question: *About The Project:*
### *In this project we've created a program in Python which attacks a user over the internet in order to steal his login information. We've also created a defense program for protecting the user from such an attack.*

## :white_check_mark: *Initialize The Project:*
### *What are the Hardware requirements?*
* *A Laptop with Linux OS*
* *Network Interface Controller (NIC) - Tenda in our case.*

*Clone the project using the Command Line by typing the command:*
`git clone https://github.com/LeviEyal/EvilTwin.git`
* *Run* `sudo install python3` *in the Command Line to download Python.*
* *Run* `sudo sh Requierments.sh` *in the Command Line to download all the requirements.*
* *Run* `sudo python3 start.py` *in the Command Line to execute the program.*

## ‚öîÔ∏è *__ATTACK:__*
*Will simulate scanning of packages before they're sent to the country, and will notify their departure via message. When a package is sent, it will be stored in the Redis database service as cache. To simulate arrival of the package, the Shipment Simulator will generate a QRCode for each package, which holds all the package's information and store it in Firebase cloud storage.*

## üõ°Ô∏è *__DEFENSE:__*  
*We'll display the data from Redis' cache in the Dashboard for every package which is departed to it's destination and update that data in Real-time. The Dashboard also includes statistics such as number of packages per country district, charts and graphs of packages' size distribution per district and type of tax billing distribution per district.*
